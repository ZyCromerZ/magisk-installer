## Function
# ui_print <msg>
#   print <msg> to console
#   Avoid using 'echo' as it will not display in custom recovery's console
# abort <msg>
#   print error message <msg> to console and terminate installation
#   Avoid using 'exit' as it will skip the termination cleanup steps
# set_perm <target> <owner> <group> <permission> [context]
#   if [context] is not set, the default is "u:object_r:system_file:s0"
#   this function is a shorthand for the following commands:
#      chown owner.group target
#      chmod permission target
#      chcon context target
# set_perm_recursive <directory> <owner> <group> <dirpermission> <filepermission> [context]
#   if [context] is not set, the default is "u:object_r:system_file:s0"
#   for all files in <directory>, it will call:
#      set_perm file owner group filepermission context
#   for all directories in <directory> (including itself), it will call:
#      set_perm dir owner group dirpermission context
